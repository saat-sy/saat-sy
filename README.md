### What I'm Working On
- **Timbre-Agent v2**: Streaming agent that analyzes video frames in realtime and pipes emotion/scene data straight to Google Lyria for on-the-fly music generation. No more uploading, waiting, downloading.
- **MMChat**: Building a chat where some people type and others talk simultaneously. Voice participants hear TTS of text messages, texters get STT transcripts. Figuring out the latency demons as we speak.

### Recent Highlights
- **Timbre**: Multimodal AI that scores videos by analyzing visual + audio cues through Bedrock, then generates matching soundtracks. Orchestrated with Step Functions state machines because Lambda timeouts are for cowards.
- **Hyprlander**: ReAct agent in Go that parses natural language into Hyprland IPC calls. No more grepping through config files! Just tell your WM what to do and watch it happen.
